# üîê Intrusion Detection System (IDS) ‚Äì AI Upgradable

## üìò Overview

This project is a foundational **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** built using Python to monitor and analyze live network traffic for suspicious or malicious activity. It is designed as an entry-level cybersecurity tool, with future plans to integrate **AI-based anomaly detection**.

The current version implements a **rule-based detection system**, which serves as a stepping stone for learning and eventually upgrading to a machine learning-powered IDS.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Develop a basic, functioning IDS using Python.
- Detect common types of network attacks such as:
  - Port scanning
  - ICMP flooding
  - Abnormal packet frequency
- Log alerts and store suspicious event records.
- Gain hands-on experience in cybersecurity and networking.
- Design a system architecture that is **AI-upgradable**.

## üö¶ How It Works (Basic IDS)

1. Captures live network packets using a sniffer.
2. Applies basic rules to identify malicious patterns.
3. Triggers alerts based on:
   - Excessive connection attempts
   - Rapid ICMP requests
   - Unusual port access
4. Logs alerts to a file for analysis or monitoring.

---

## üîç Example Detection Rules

- **Port Scan Detection**: Multiple SYN packets to different ports from the same IP within a short interval.
- **ICMP Flood Detection**: High volume of ICMP packets in a short time.
- **Unauthorized Port Access**: Connections targeting restricted or inactive ports.

---

## üöÄ Future Upgrade: AI-Enhanced IDS

Our long-term goal is to enhance this system using **machine learning**, enabling detection of unknown threats and reducing false positives.

Future enhancements will include:
- Feature extraction from live traffic
- Model training on labeled datasets (e.g., NSL-KDD)
- Real-time AI-based anomaly detection
- Adaptive alert generation
