# System Design: AI-Based Scam Detection Website

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the system architecture and features for the enhanced AI-based scam detection website. The goal is to create a professional, attractive, interactive, and functional website that is uniquely tailored for the Ethiopian context. The website will be built with a Next.js frontend and will include features such as user reporting, AI learning, localization in Amharic and English, and a light/dark mode theme.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

The system will be composed of the following main components:

- **Frontend:** A Next.js application will provide the user interface. It will be responsible for rendering the website, handling user interactions, and communicating with the backend.
- **Backend:** A backend service will handle the core logic of the application. This includes the AI-based scam detection, user reporting, and AI learning.
- **AI Model:** A machine learning model will be used to detect scams. The model will be trained on a dataset of scam and legitimate messages and will be continuously improved through user feedback.
- **Database:** A database will be used to store user reports, and other relevant data.

## 3. Feature Breakdown

### 3.1. AI-Based Scam Detection

The core feature of the website is the AI-based scam detection. This will be based on the existing functionality but will be enhanced to be more accurate and to support a wider range of scams. The system will analyze text input from the user and classify it as either a scam or legitimate. The classification will be based on a machine learning model that has been trained on a large dataset of scam and legitimate messages.

### 3.2. User Reporting

A new feature will be added to allow users to report scams that they have encountered. This will help to improve the accuracy of the AI model and to identify new types of scams. When a user reports a scam, they will be asked to provide the text of the scam message and any other relevant information. This information will be stored in the database and will be used to retrain the AI model.

### 3.3. AI Learning

The AI model will be continuously improved through a process of AI learning. This will involve retraining the model on a regular basis using the latest data from user reports. This will ensure that the model is always up-to-date and is able to detect the latest types of scams.

### 3.4. Localization

The website will be localized in Amharic and English. This will make the website accessible to a wider range of users in Ethiopia. The language of the website will be automatically detected based on the user's browser settings, but the user will also be able to manually switch between languages.

### 3.5. Light/Dark Mode

The website will have a light/dark mode theme. This will allow users to customize the appearance of the website to their liking. The theme will be automatically switched based on the user's system settings, but the user will also be able to manually switch between themes.

### 3.6. Enhanced UI/UX

The user interface and user experience of the website will be enhanced to make it more professional, attractive, interactive, and functional. This will involve a complete redesign of the website, with a focus on usability and aesthetics.

## 4. Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Python, Flask, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Deployment:** Vercel (for Next.js frontend), render (for Flask backend)
